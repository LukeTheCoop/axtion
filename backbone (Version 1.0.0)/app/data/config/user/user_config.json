", "last_used_prompt": "An ambitious cat, confident and strong, speeds recklessly through life on a motorcycle until a fiery crash forces it to reconsider its path. Alone and reflective in the wreckage, the cat reinvents itself, studying diligently and working earnestly. It takes pride in simpler joys: cooking meals, lifting weights responsibly, and reconnecting affectionately with others. Finally mature, it finds lasting peace relaxing at home, eyes wide open, embracing life\u2019s calmer moments. \n\nMake the crash only a couple sentences and force most attention on the building up of the cat.\n\nMake it a First-Person (Cat\u2019s Inner Voice)\n\nExample:\n\n\u201cI woke up to smoke everywhere. My paws burned as I ran from that nightmare, but I knew this wasn\u2019t the end\u2014this was the start of my story.\u201d\n\n\t\u2022\tWhy this works: First-person creates intimacy, humor, and emotional depth. The cat\u2019s perspective can become endearing, funny, or emotionally profound, enhancing engagement.", "last_used_genre": "cat"}
