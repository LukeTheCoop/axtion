```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "Ever wonder what goes through a cat's mind during those quiet moments of observation? ", 
      "video": "cat_solo_cat_observing.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Some days they're contemplating the universe while watching raindrops race down windows. ", 
      "video": "cat_cat_next_to_rainy_window_alone.mp4"
    },
