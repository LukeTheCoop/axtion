I'll create a short, sad military script about a city battle that matches perfectly with the available videos. Each line will be crafted specifically for the corresponding video clip.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "What was once a thriving metropolis now stands in ruins, a testament to the brutality of urban warfare.",
      "video": "military_wartorn_city_drone_shot.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Our unit was sent in to clear the remaining hostiles, moving cautiously through streets we once swore to protect.",
      "video": "military_soldiers_walking_in_wartorn_city.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Gunfire erupted from windows above, forcing us to take defensive positions.",
      "video": "military_shooting_out_of_window_city.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "We pushed forward through the chaos, each step bringing us deeper into the heart of the conflict.",
      "video": "military_soldiers_running_in_city_action.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Our team breached a building where hostages were being held, every second critical to their survival.",
      "video": "military_soldier_running_through_a_building_with_a_gun_hostages.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "From my position, I could spot enemy movements across the devastated landscape.",
      "video": "military_soldier_sniping_out_of_building.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Then came the explosion that changed everything. Rodriguez was down.",
      "video": "military_running_from_bombs_fire_desert.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "We rushed to evacuate him through the contested streets, every moment under fire.",
      "video": "military_med_evac_city.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "His last words were for his family as we carried him to safety.",
      "video": "military_soldiers_carrying_injured_soldiers.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Today, I stand alone at the memorial for those we lost in that forgotten city battle, their sacrifice etched into my memory forever.",
      "video": "military_soldier_at_funeral_for_comrades.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
