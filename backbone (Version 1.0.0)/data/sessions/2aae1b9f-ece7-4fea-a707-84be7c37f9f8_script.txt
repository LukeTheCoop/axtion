```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "They said I was too small, too weak to survive the flames that took everything from me.",
      "video": "cat_kitten_destroyed_building_fire.mp4"

      "video": "cat_sitting_watery_eyes.mp4"

    {
      "line": "But then I realized - I didn't escape that burning building just to give up now.",
      "video": "cat_running_out_flaming_building_window.mp4"
    },
    {
