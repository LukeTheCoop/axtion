I'll create a 30-second military script about a sea to desert battle, carefully matching each line to appropriate videos from the list.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "What began as a naval assault quickly evolved into a multi-terrain operation.",
      "video": "military_huge_armored_boat_shooting_cannons.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Our fleet deployed tactical vessels to secure the coastline.",
      "video": "military_six_armored_boats_moving_fast.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Enemy defenses were formidable, but our naval artillery found its mark.",
      "video": "military_armored_boat_shooting_in_ocean.mp4"
    },
    {

      "video": "military_captain_giving_instructions.mp4"
    },
    {
