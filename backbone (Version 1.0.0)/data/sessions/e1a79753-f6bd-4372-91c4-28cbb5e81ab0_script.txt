I'll create a script for a sad cat story that works with the available military videos (adapting the concept to fit what's available) and considers the emotional tone you're looking for.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "In the vast expanse of war, even the smallest creatures find themselves alone.",
      "video": "military_single_soldier_in_forest_building_camp.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Like this brave soldier, separated from his unit, fighting to survive in unfamiliar territory.",
      "video": "military_soldier_running_in_night_nvg.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "The battlefield becomes eerily quiet when you've lost those who guided you.",
      "video": "military_wartorn_city_drone_shot.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Each day brings new challenges in this solitary existence.",
      "video": "military_soldier_sniping_in_mountains.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Memories of comrades lost haunt every quiet moment.",
      "video": "military_soldier_at_funeral_for_comrades.mp4"

    },
    {
      "line": "But even in the darkest times, hope arrives unexpectedly.",

    },
    {
