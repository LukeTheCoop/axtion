I notice you're asking for a cat-related script with military footage, which is an unusual combination. While I can create a script using the military footage available, I should note that these videos may not be ideal for a sad cat story. 

Let me create a script that could work with the available footage, adapting the concept to fit what we have:

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "They said a soldier's life was lonely, until I found him on that battlefield. ",
      "video": "military_single_soldier_in_forest_building_camp.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I was just a stray, surviving in a war-torn world. ",
      "video": "military_wartorn_city_drone_shot.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "He gave me shelter when bombs fell around us. ",
      "video": "military_soldiers_inside_building_as_a_team.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Every morning, he'd check if I was safe. ",
      "video": "military_two_soldiers_in_camp_talking.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I followed him everywhere, even when danger was near. ",
      "video": "military_soldiers_walking_in_wartorn_city.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Then came the day his team had to evacuate. ",
      "video": "military_helicopter_base_with_soldiers_running_in_and_out_desert.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "He looked back one last time, our eyes meeting across the distance. ",
      "video": "military_soldier_standing_in_cargo_plane_looking_towards_camera.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Now I wait by the camp they left behind, hoping someday he'll return. ",
      "video": "military_bridge_drone_shot.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```
