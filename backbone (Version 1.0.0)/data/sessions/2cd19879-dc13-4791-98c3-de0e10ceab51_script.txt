I'll create a motivational cat video script that starts sad and becomes powerful, with a strong hook and short sentences that match perfectly with the available videos.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "They said I was too small to survive after the fire destroyed my home.",
      "video": "cat_kitten_destroyed_building_fire.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I sat alone by the window, watching the rain fall like my tears.",
      "video": "cat_sitting_alone_rainy_window.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "My eyes were filled with pain and uncertainty.",
      "video": "cat_sitting_watery_eyes.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "The world had burned everything I knew.",
      "video": "cat_young_cat_burnt_building_fire.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "But something inside me refused to give up.",
      "video": "cat_standing_looking_around.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I started small, learning to move with purpose.",
      "video": "cat_long_strides_grass_field.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I trained my body to become stronger than my past.",
      "video": "cat_lifting_weights_protein_shake.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I learned to stand tall on my own two feet.",
      "video": "cat_on_hind_legs_flexing_muscles.mp4"
    },
    {

    {
      "line": "From survivor to warrior â€“ your past doesn't define your future.",
