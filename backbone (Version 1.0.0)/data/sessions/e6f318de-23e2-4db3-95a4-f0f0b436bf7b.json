I spent days alone by the window, watching the rain and contemplating my choices. The old me was gone, and my eyes welled up thinking about who I wanted to become. I started small, taking careful steps in a new direction. I enrolled in classes and studied harder than I ever had before. I learned to type and focused on building a real career. My education became my priority as I attended every lecture. I discovered the joy of cooking for myself instead of living on fast food. I started exercising responsibly, building strength the right way. I even went grocery shopping, making healthier choices. I learned to play again, finding joy in simple things. I reconnected with family, spending time with the younger generation. I found comfort in the company of others who shared my new values. We played together and groomed each other, building real friendships. I welcomed human connection back into my life. I learned to ask for what I needed instead of taking it by force. Now I appreciate the quiet moments, just watching the world go by. Sometimes I still feel curious about everything around me. But mostly, I'm content to rest in my living room, eyes wide with wonder at how far I've come. This is me now - peaceful, present, and finally at home with myself.
