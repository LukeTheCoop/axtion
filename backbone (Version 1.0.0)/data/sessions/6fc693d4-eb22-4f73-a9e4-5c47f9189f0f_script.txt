I'll create a sad but engaging cat story script that matches perfectly with the available videos. I'll make sure each line aligns with the corresponding video clip while being mindful of the emotional tone needed for a story about a lonely cat who lost its mother.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "Every morning used to start with cuddles and warmth. ", 
      "video": "cat_adult_cat_with_kitten.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "But one day, everything changed. ", 
      "video": "cat_cat_next_to_rainy_window_alone.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Now I spend my days watching the world go by. ", 
      "video": "cat_solo_cat_observing.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Sometimes I try to play, but it's not the same without her. ", 
      "video": "cat_cat_playing_with_colorful_ball.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I remember how she taught me to pounce. ", 
      "video": "cat_cat_hesitant_pounce.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "The empty space beside me feels so cold now. ", 
      "video": "cat_cats_cuddling_one_sitting_one_lying.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "I hide away sometimes, hoping she'll come find me. ", 
      "video": "cat_cat_lying_under_object.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "They say time heals all wounds, but some days the tears still come. ", 
      "video": "cat_lonely_cat_watery_eyes.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```
