I'll create a short military script about a desert battle that perfectly matches available videos, with each line crafted specifically for the corresponding video.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "The desert sun beat down as our forward units spotted enemy positions on the horizon.",
      "video": "military_soldier_sniping_in_mountains.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Command quickly mobilized our armored division, tanks rolling across the harsh terrain.",
      "video": "military_six_tank_convoy.mp4"

    },
    {
      "line": "Enemy vehicles erupted in flames as our precision strikes found their mark.",
      "video": "military_armored_vehicle_on_fire_desert.mp4"
    },
    {
