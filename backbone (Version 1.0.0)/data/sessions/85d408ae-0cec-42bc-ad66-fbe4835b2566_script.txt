I'll create a motivational cat video script that starts sad but becomes powerful, with a perfect hook and lines that match each video perfectly.

```json
{
  "config": [
    {
      "line": "Ever felt like the world was watching you through a rainy window, judging your every move?",
      "video": "cat_sitting_alone_rainy_window.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "That feeling when tears well up and you wonder if anyone truly sees you.",
      "video": "cat_sitting_watery_eyes.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "Sometimes we hide away from the world, retreating to our safe spaces.",
      "video": "cat_sit_to_lie_under_bed.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "But then comes that moment when you decide enough is enough.",
      "video": "cat_standing_looking_around.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "You gather your strength, ready to face whatever comes next.",
      "video": "cat_crouched_ready_to_pounce\n\n.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "You leap into action, refusing to be defined by your past.",
      "video": "cat_crouching_pounce.mp4"
    },
    {
      "line": "You run from the flames of doubt that once consumed you.",
      "video": "cat_running_out_flaming_building_window.mp4"
    },
    {
