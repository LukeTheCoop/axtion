Intelligence had confirmed enemy vessels were converging on our strategic supply routes. Admiral Hayes gathered his commanders for final briefing before engagement. \"This battle will determine control of the entire western seaboard,\" the Captain explained to his crew. Our surveillance drones captured enemy movements, transmitting real-time coordinates to command. The radar operators tracked multiple hostile signatures approaching from the northeast. Six destroyer-class vessels formed our forward assault formation, cutting through the waves at maximum speed. As we approached the enemy fleet, our aircraft carrier launched fighter jets to establish air superiority. The massive naval armada represented the full might of our maritime defense forces. Without warning, enemy vessels opened fire, their artillery shells creating massive water plumes. Our gunners returned fire, the deck shuddering beneath the recoil of our main batteries. The battle intensified as our submarine launched torpedoes at the enemy's exposed flank. A direct hit! One of the enemy vessels erupted in flames, creating a tactical gap in their defense. \"Fire teams to the port side! We have a situation developing!\" shouted Lieutenant Rodriguez. Our damage control teams rushed to extinguish fires that threatened ammunition storage. The battle took an unexpected turn as volcanic activity near the island created hazardous conditions. A distress call came in - we had men overboard from one of our forward vessels. Medevac helicopters were dispatched immediately to retrieve wounded sailors from the churning waters. As night fell, our night vision capabilities gave us the tactical advantage we needed. The decisive moment came when our artillery batteries coordinated a synchronized barrage. By morning, the enemy fleet had been neutralized, with several vessels captured intact. The victory came at a cost - we held a solemn ceremony for the brave sailors lost in the engagement. Operation Neptune's Wrath secured our maritime borders, ensuring safe passage for civilian and military vessels for years to come.
